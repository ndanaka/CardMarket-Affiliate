          In the 9 days remaining, you manage to earn another 225 points,
          bringing your total to 475. Unfortunately, the upgrade to Platinum
          requires a total of 500 points, and you are 25 points short. The
          30-day period ends on October 30th and your points total is reset to
          0. You remain at Gold level and a new 30-day period starts on October
