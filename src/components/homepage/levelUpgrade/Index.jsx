            Affiliate Level Points are earned from new active depositing
            clients, as well as your clientsâ€™ trading activity. Your performance
            is measured across a 30-day period, starting the first time you earn
            points. The goal is to collect as many points as possible in that
            period. Your level will be automatically upgraded the day after you
            earn enough points. Each time you level-up, your commission
            increases. In the event you are unable to reach a new level within
            30 days, your points will be reset for the next period.
